Rumbster is a fake smtp server for email testing in Ruby.
Rumbster was developed to as a way to acceptance test email sending applications.

== Requirements

* Ruby 1.8.7 or later (may work with earlier versions)

== Usage

A good source for usage information is the unit tests in the 
test directory.   Below is an example of the usage.

 class TestEmails < Test::Unit::TestCase
   def setup
     @rumbster = Rumbster.new(port)
     @message_observer = MailMessageObserver.new

     @rumbster.add_observer @message_observer
     @rumbster.add_observer FileMessageObserver.new('some/directory')

     @rumbster.start
   end

   def teardown
     @rumbster.stop
   end

   def test_email_is_sent
     send_email
     assert_equal 1, @message_observer.messages.size
     assert_equal 'junk@junk.com', @message_observer.messages.first.to
   end
 end

== Contributing to rumbster

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
